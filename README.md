A rabbit MQ abstraction build upon lapin

To fit my needs

(work in progress) my plan is to add a bit of code at least 2-4 times per week (until I reach a satisfying point)

26/05/2020

* connection retry config

25/05/2020

* added ConsumerConfiguration, ConnectionProperties and BindingProperties

24/05/2020

* everything is hardcoded !! ;)
